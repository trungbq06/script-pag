# Spectrum
## The No Hassle Colorpicker

See the demo and docs: http://bgrins.github.com/spectrum/.

I wanted a colorpicker that didn't require images, and that had an API that made sense to me as a developer who has worked with color in a number of applications.  I had tried a number of existing plugins, but decided to try and make a smaller, simpler one.

I started using canvas, then switched to CSS gradients, since it turned out to be easier to manage, and provided better cross browser support.

Spectrum is registered as a jQuery plugin on the jQuery plugin repository here: http://plugins.jquery.com/spectrum/

Thanks to the following places for good information as this plugin was being built:
